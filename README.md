             ***Game concept***
*************************************************
Speed Connect Four
The idea was kind of derived from my love of chess and my dying desire to play a giant connect four game I seen were you had to shoot a basket a ball into a hoop. the players didn't alternate gos it was pretty much whoever made there four baskets in row first. So ofcourse there was a time element. 

One thing I notice about connect four, is that, just like chess it's pretty strategic and requires focus. To be good at it you must be able to read the board and you oponent. You must be able to think a few moves ahead, but also try to think about what your opponent is thinking. If good enough you can get to the point where you can read your oponent to the point you can control what they do with your moves.

With time an average player can seem like a great player, so let's add a time restraint. A lot of "L's" in connect four comes from silly mistakes and a lot of Draws come from having way to much time.

             ***Game Rules***
*************************************************

Player one (Black) goes first.

Players alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn. 

After each turn the player must press the stop button on timer to stop there timer and start to other players timer

On your turn, drop one of your colored discs from the top into any of the seven slots. 

The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.

The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game.

             ***Game Setup***
**************************************************

2 player game the goal would be to have the options for players to play from the same or their personnal machines. If only one player, I would like for them to be able to play against AI. 


Game will be scored one point per game. The idea is that games will go faster due to the time element. 

When Players Alternate the color of the pieces will change colors

I would like to have a reset button that clears the board and resets the clock.

            *********************************

The user will be abe to control the stop botton on the timer by either clicking it with the mouse or by pressing the space bar

I would like for the game to not start until the first player clicks the clock start button or somewhere on the board. 

Player will be able to pause the timer which pauses the game. 
when game is paused i would like for the board to gray out.

I would like for you to be able to set the timer from 1 to 5minutes. 
each player will have timer. When its the players turn their clock will light out and the other players clock will darken.  

As the clock wind down I would like for it to change colors. At 1min it turns yellow and at 30secs it turns read. 

Regardless of if anyone has connect four if the time expire whoever go it is that person loses.
